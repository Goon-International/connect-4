# Connect 4

A two-player Connect 4 program that plays matches betweenn two AIs. One imaginary player trains against the other. P1 is the learner. P2 doesn't do much improving for now. Q-Learning is the ML algorithm P1 uses to train. Double-Q Learning was tested but appears to have smaller returns and trains a lot slower. Feel free to make PRs and suggest improvements.

## Instructions:
To run the program: `python3 learner.py`

## Roadmap
1. Add more documentation to code
2. Save AI state to resume training from previous point
2. Introduce player vs computer (AI)
3. Create web UI where players can play against Connect4 bot online (and it learns from playing users)
4. Freshen up README
